### Binary Data < - > disk

If we weren't using Python, we could just use bash to write:

```bash
> printf '\x00\xff' > out.bin
> 
```

### We will use two utility functions to wrap boilerplate:

**utils.py**

```python
def readData(fn, mode = 'r'):
    FH = open(fn, mode)
    data = FH.read()
    FH.close()
    return data

def writeData(fn, data, mode = 'w'):
    FH = open(fn, mode)
    FH.write(data)
    FH.close()
```

#### Write data

```python
>>> import utils as ut
>>> s = '\x00\xff'
>>> ut.writeData('out.bin', s, 'wb')
>>>
```

Check it in Terminal:

```bash
> hexdump out.bin
0000000 00 ff                                          
0000002
>
```

#### Read data

```python
>>> ut.readData('out.bin','rb')
'\x00\xff'
>>>
```

What follows is not really important for the topic.

It surprises me that the default mode works here.  The ``'rb'`` is unnecessary.  

According to the [docs](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#open)

> If mode is omitted, it defaults to 'r'. The default is to use text mode, which may convert '\n' characters to a platform-specific representation on writing and back on reading. Thus, when opening a binary file, you should append 'b' to the mode value to open the file in binary mode, which will improve portability. (Appending 'b' is useful even on systems that donâ€™t treat binary and text files differently, where it serves as documentation.)

So, for example:

```python
>>> ut.writeData('out.bin','\x00\xff\n','wb')
>>> ut.readData('out.bin')
'\x00\xff\n'
>>> ut.writeData('out.bin','\x00\xff\n','w')
>>> ut.readData('out.bin')
'\x00\xff\n'
>>>
```

No difference.
